Hello @everyone!. This code has been created to process each frame of a video, measure the percentage of brightness in each frame, save the data in a row matrix and then graph it for visualization.

"Currently, there is no conventional formula for brightness calculation, and the same image-processing tool may employ several different brightness measures. However, stimuli, equibright according to one measure, may differ more, than ten times according to another." [1]

The program creates two folders where the video frames and the processed frames will be saved.

Using the stimulus coordinates provided given by "table 1." [1], we observe that for gray it is a value of 76

The value of grey(76) we use to process and binarize each pixel of a frame
